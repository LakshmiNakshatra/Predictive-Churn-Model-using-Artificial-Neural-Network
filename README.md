# Predictive-Churn-Model-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
A predictive churn model is designed using ANN which predicts the risk of churn for every customer.  Probability of churn for each individual customer will be calculated, aiding the bank to rank its customers based on his/her churn rate and implementing preventive measures. Predictions are made based on the probability threshold value.
